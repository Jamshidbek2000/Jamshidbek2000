	<summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Jamshidbek's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
	As a curious Computer Science student with limited coding skills, I soon realized that the theory-heavy education offered by traditional universities wasn't cutting it for me. I strived for a more hands-on approach, which led me to the dynamic and engaging programming community at 42 Heilbronn. Here, I find myself constantly challenged and excited by the interesting projects and stimulating coursework on offer. Thanks to the supportive guidance of my peers and curriculum, I have grown tremendously as a developer, pushing myself to explore new horizons and constantly improve my skills.
